Some themes have visual variations defined in the CSS. It can be a lighter color scheme, different arrows
or something else. You can read about each variation in the documentation for each theme.

You can add multiple variations byseparating them by spaces, f.ex **"light smallarow"**.

Example::

    Galleria.configure({
        variation: 'light'
    });
