Galleria comes with a built-in horizontal carousel. This options is for activating / deactivating the carousel feature.
Setting this to ``true``, the carousel will be automatically applied if the total sum of thumbnails width exceeds the thumbnail container.
This will be re-calculated on resize.

If you set this to ``false``, you will prevent Galleria from adding the carousel.
